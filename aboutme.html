	<h3>Wayne High School</h3>
	<p>
		Before going to the Miami Valley Career Technology Center, I attended Wayne High School. At my home school I made many friends, I took honors courses, and I participated (and I still do participate) in marching/pep band.

	<h3>Huber Heights, Ohio</h3>
	<p>
		I lived at the same house, in the same place my whole life. The city of Huber Heights is my home, there is not another place on this Earth that I know so well. It is probably safe to say about 90% of my friends are from my home town and I simply 
		love all the people here.

	<h3>Pets/School Activities/Hobbies</h3>
	<h4>My dog</h4>
	<p class="space">
		I have a young golden retriever that goes by the name Flipper. Her name comes from the events of her early life as she was unfortunately frozen in ice as a very young puppy misshaping her front legs.
		This handicap does not bother her though, my father and I adopted her and she has adapted well to movement in the 5 years since the winter she was born in.
	</p>
	<h4>Wayne High School Marching Band</h4>
	<p class="space">
		Marching band has opened many doors for me: my band director has given me resposibility as a leader (for drill), responsibility as an equipment manager (assuring that any instruments or accessories are organized for travel or in field/auditorium), and 
		I have learned to work with many different people, becoming friends with as many as possible.
	</p>
	<h4>My hobbies</h4>
	<p>
		
			Video Gaming<br>
			Computer Programming<br>
			Playing Alto/Bari Saxophone<br>
			Music Composition<br>
			Space Science<br>
