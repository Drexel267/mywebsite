	<h3>Welcome!</h3>
	<p>My name is Zachary Phillips and I am part of the junior class for Game Programming and Web Design at the
	Miami Valley Career Technology Center. My first semester was dedicated to learning the concepts of C++ programming and basic program logic. 
	Now I am developing skills in using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and PHP so that I can create webpages that are compatible with most modern devices.

	<h3>Educational Goal</h3>
	<p>
		Currently I am trying to decide to major/minor between my three interests: space, music, and computer science.
		I simply want to go to a good college and get a degree in one of the things that I love.

	<h3>Employment Goal</h3>
	<p>
		Jobs are often very difficult and it is my goal to find a well paying job that makes me happy
		while I work. I want a job where I can make a living while expressing myself and some of my interests.
